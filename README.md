# airbnb-clone-project
This is a full-stack Airbnb clone built to replicate the core functionalities of the Airbnb platform. The project allows users to browse, book, and list rental properties, with features like user authentication, property details, booking system, and responsive design.

üîß Technology Stack
Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB

Authentication: JWT

Deployment: [Include platforms like Render, Vercel, etc., if used]

‚ú® Feature Breakdown
User registration and login

Property listing and booking

Search and filter functionality

Secure authentication and session management

Mobile-responsive UI

This project was developed as part of a backend development course to deepen my understanding of full-stack web development and real-world application architecture.

Team Roles

üóÑÔ∏è Database Administrator (DBA)
Role: Manages the database infrastructure, ensuring data integrity, security, and performance.
Responsibilities:

Design and optimize the database schema for property listings, bookings, and users

Set up indexing and query optimization

Handle database backups, recovery plans, and security measures

Monitor and scale the database as the application grows

üé® Frontend Developer
Role: Develops the user-facing part of the application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks.

Ensure a seamless user experience across devices

üõ°Ô∏è QA Engineer (Quality Assurance)
Role: Ensures the app works as expected and is free of bugs.
Responsibilities:

Write and run test cases for core functionalities like login, search, and booking

Perform manual and automated testing

Report and track bugs and performance issues

Validate user flows and edge cases
Database Design
This project uses a document-based database (MongoDB) to store and manage data. Below are the key entities and their relationships:

üìå Key Entities & Fields
1. User
userId: Unique identifier

name: Full name of the user

email: Email address (unique)

password: Hashed password

role: e.g., guest or host

2. Property
propertyId: Unique identifier

title: Name/title of the property

description: Property details

location: Address or city

hostId: References the User who owns the property

3. Booking
bookingId: Unique identifier

userId: References the guest (User)

propertyId: References the booked property

checkInDate: Start date of the booking

checkOutDate: End date of the booking

4. Review
reviewId: Unique identifier

userId: References the user who left the review

propertyId: References the reviewed property

rating: Numerical score (e.g., 1‚Äì5)

comment: Optional text feedback

5. Payment
paymentId: Unique identifier

bookingId: References the booking

amount: Total amount paid

status: e.g., paid, pending, failed

paymentMethod: e.g., card, M-Pesa

üîÑ Entity Relationships
A User can have many Properties (if the user is a host)

A Property can have many Bookings and many Reviews

A Booking belongs to one User and one Property

A Review belongs to one User and one Property

A Payment is associated with one Booking

API Security
Securing the backend API is critical to protect sensitive user information and maintain the integrity of the system. Below are key security measures implemented in this project:

‚úÖ Authentication
Only registered users can access certain features (e.g., booking a property). We use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to authenticate users securely and manage sessions.

‚úÖ Authorization
After authentication, users are granted different levels of access depending on their roles. For example, only property owners can edit or delete their listings.

‚úÖ Rate Limiting
To prevent abuse (e.g., brute-force login attempts), rate limiting is enforced using middleware that restricts the number of API calls allowed per IP over a set time window.

‚úÖ Input Validation and Sanitization
All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

‚úÖ HTTPS Enforcement
All data transmission will be secured over HTTPS to protect against data interception during communication.

Why Security Matters
Protecting User Data: Personal data (emails, passwords, bookings) must remain confidential and secure.

Securing Transactions: If integrated with payment systems, ensuring secure processing is essential to avoid fraud.

Preventing Abuse: Without proper rate limits and authorization checks, attackers could exploit system vulnerabilities.

Building Trust: Users are more likely to use a platform that ensures their safety and privacy.

‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline
A CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code, making development faster and more reliable.

Why CI/CD is Important
Automated Testing: Ensures code changes don‚Äôt break existing functionality.

Faster Deployments: Reduces manual work by automatically deploying to production or staging environments.

Improved Collaboration: Helps developers merge code safely with automatic builds and tests.

Error Detection: Quickly identifies bugs and integration issues during development.

Tools Used / Recommended
GitHub Actions: For automating workflows like testing and deployment on every push or pull request.

Docker: For containerizing the application, ensuring consistent environments across development and production.

Heroku / Render / Vercel: For simplified deployment and hosting.
